# Early Tomato Disease Detection by applying Deep Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning models for the early and accurate detection of tomato diseases. In particular, we compare the performance of several popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including VGG16, ResNet18, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet-B0, and two other CNN models. We use a publicly available dataset of tomato leaf images provided by the PlantVillage project.
